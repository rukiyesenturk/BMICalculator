#BMICalculator

I have developed an application that calculates the body mass index in accordance with the MVC architecture. I have set a range where you can choose your weight and height with UISlider. In the model part, I gave the value, advice and color properties in the BMI struct. In CalculatorBrain, I calculated the bmi, gave advice and color according to the index range. I transferred the values made to my second screen and reflected our values on the screen with advice.
